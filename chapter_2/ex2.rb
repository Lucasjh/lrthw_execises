# A Comment
# Octothorpe hides the text after it in a single line

puts 'I could have code like this.' # And the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to 'disable' or comment out a line of code:
# puts 'this won't run'

puts 'This will run.'
puts ''
puts 'Can you find a key combo in RubyMine to comment out a line of code?'
puts ''
puts 'Indeed. Key combo "Cmd+/" does the trick'

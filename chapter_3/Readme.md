`When you use only integers in ruby with the math operators, then it will return only integers.
Therefore, if you in put 10/3, it will return 3 even though it is really 3.333...  
If you input 10.0/3.0, ruby will then return floating point integers, and return a more accurate 3.333... (not sure how my 10th's of 10th's of 10th's it will show me)`

#####Do you like string interpolation or format strings? Why?
- I like interpolation better because it seems a bit more intuitive to me,
If not just more familiar. Seems like i have to type less characters to use
interpolation as well.



 _Checked with rubocop. Lots of formatting issues with the curly braces and 
indentations for hashes. I also removed all unnecessary double quotes._

What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?

- Reading and writing.
- Attention to detail.
- Spotting Differences.

Please explain these three skills in your own words.

- Reading and writing:

    Reading and writing skills are needed to understand how the symbols and words of a programming language relate to natural languages. Also, good typing skills are essential to enter the characters (often the weird ones that rarely get used otherwise) of a string of text or a command.
    
- Attention to detail:

    One small typo in a paragraph describing your day may be overlooked by your friend, but a computer program may not run if one character is wrong. Also, attention to detail can separate the good from the great in all walk of life.
    
- Spotting differences:

    This is a nessecary skill for programmers to find minute differences between a couple blocks of code.
    
Why do you need to not copy and paste?

    Typing in the exercises verbatim will build muscle memory and reinforce good habits. Copy and pasting will completely undermine the effort.
      
Why is Practice and Persistence important?

    Again, muscle memory. I have spent enough time on steep and long learning curves alike with my persuits in music and other things to know that there is no easy way out of learning motor skill oriented talents.
